## Code Structure

### 1. **HTML (index.html)**
   - Contains the basic structure of the app: search form, results area, and dark/light mode toggle buttons.

### 2. **CSS (style.css)**
   - Styles the app using Sass variables for colors, typography, and layout. Includes rules for both light and dark modes, along with responsive design for different screen sizes.

### 3. **JavaScript (main.ts)**
   - Handles the logic for searching lyrics and YouTube videos. Uses `fetch` to interact with external APIs and updates the DOM with results.

### 4. **Sass Variables**:
   - Defined at the top of `style.css`, the Sass variables make it easier to manage and modify the app's design system, such as colors, font families, and transition timings.

## API Keys

- **YouTube Data API Key**:
  - You will need a valid **YouTube Data API key** to fetch YouTube video information. You can get your key from the Google Cloud Console and replace it in the code.

  ```typescript
  const youtubeAPIKey = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY';
  ```

- **Lyrics API**:
  - The app uses the **Lyrics.ovh API** which doesn‚Äôt require an API key for basic usage.

---

## Additional Features

- **Keyboard Support**: Press **Enter** after filling in the artist and song title fields to trigger the search.
- **Loading Spinner**: A spinner is shown while the app fetches the lyrics and YouTube data.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adjusts its layout depending on the screen size, providing a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Known Issues

- **API Limits**: The YouTube API may have rate limits depending on the API key usage.
- **No Results**: If no video or lyrics are found, appropriate messages will be displayed.
